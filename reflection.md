I had some challenges involving discovering how to deal with minimal visual details like text spacing, coloring, font styles, etc. However, I had a lot of difficulty in finding how to change margins but I figured it out after exploring changing margin and padding. With that in mind, I could identify the main differences between the two and decide which one to change for achieving a visual look like the screenshot. Furthermore, I honestly found it challenging to find the exact colors to match the screenshot but I think I did the best job I could do in this case.
